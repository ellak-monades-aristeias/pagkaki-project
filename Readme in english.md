My design is about a bench, which purpose is to improve the image of the city through an 
attitude of rest. This object is achieved by creating a simple organic form, which fits 
flexibly into any type of structured environment, with both innovative and understudable form.

It can be made of alouminium or sheet metal.

Finally, intended to be placed in closed or open public spaces to serve the citizens.
